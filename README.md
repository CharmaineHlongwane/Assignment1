# Assignment1 Parallel computing 

This is a program illustrating the basic use of the fork-join framework.
Finding the lowest point of a 2D mathematical function using the Monte Carlo method.

## PREREQUISITES 

   
## USAGE
    1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing source files.
    3. Compile the program using the following command: javac *.java
    4. Run the compiled program in terminal with arguments : rows, colomnus,xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, search density

    You should see the output:
    • all the run parameters given as command-line arguments;
    • the total time taken;
    • the number of grid points visited/evaluated
    • and the result: the location and value of the global minimum found.
